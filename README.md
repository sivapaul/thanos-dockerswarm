# Thanos + Docker Swarm
## Thanos Components

  Sidecar: connects to Prometheus, reads its data for query and/or uploads it to cloud storage.
  Store Gateway: serves metrics inside of a cloud storage bucket.
  Compactor: compacts, downsamples and applies retention on the data stored in cloud storage bucket.
  Receiver: receives data from Prometheusâ€™ remote-write WAL, exposes it and/or upload it to cloud storage.
  Ruler/Rule: evaluates recording and alerting rules against data in Thanos for exposition and/or upload.
  Querier/Query: implements Prometheus' v1 API to aggregate data from the underlying components.
